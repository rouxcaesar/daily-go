Variable Scope - if an entity is declared wihtin a function, it is local to that function. If declared outside of a function, it is visible in all files of the package to which it belongs.

If a name begins with an upper-case letter, then it is exported, which means that it is visible and accessible outside of its own package and may be referred to by other parts of the program.

The Go style guide for names uses camelcase, just like JavaScript.

There are four major kinds of declarations: var, const, type, and func.
