Go has three different data structures that allow you to manage collections of data: arrays, slices, and maps (hashes).

An array in Go is a fixed-length data type that contains a conitguous block of elements of the same type. This is different from other languages like Ruby or JS where an array can contain elements of different types.

An array is declared/initialized by specifying the type of data to be stored and the total number of elements required (array length).

Ex: var array [5]int --> This declares an arry of five elements all of type int.

Once an array is declared, neither the type of data being stored nor its length can be changed.
